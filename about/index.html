        Severance is a psychological thriller and science fiction series that explores the boundary between work and personal life. The story centers around employees at Lumon Industries who undergo a mysterious procedure called "severance," which surgically divides their memories between their work and personal lives.

        The series was primarily filmed in New York City, with many scenes set within the sleek yet eerie offices of Lumon Industries. The show's atmospheric setting plays a crucial role in reinforcing its themes of control, identity, and confinement. The production utilized a variety of modern office spaces and sound stages to create the sterile, almost dystopian environment that is central to the show's tone.
